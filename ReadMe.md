## About the project

For a decent few years now, I've kept building on code I wrote back in school. Containers and file management I never really needed. While it has worked decently, it turned more and more into a copy of C#'s basic classes since I liked the way those were setup.

But for the sake of my own learning and to simplify the code I write, I'd like to start over on this collection of code with a more C++-oriented mindset, trying to use the standard library as much as possible instead of reinventing the wheel constantly.

## Project goals

* Further my understanding in when and how the C++ standard library should and can be used.
* Rebuild the set of useful classes and code not otherwise available in STL, to hopefully serve as a good base for the future.
* Let the repository be easy to include for use in other projects.
* Target C++20 to be able to use some additional features added there.
